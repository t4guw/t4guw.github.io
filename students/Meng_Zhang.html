  <h2>Meng Zhang</h2>

  <p>
    This capstone project presented an opportunity to delve into advanced problem-solving using LeetCode. LeetCode is a
    platform known for its challenging computer science problems and widespread recognition among technology companies.
    During this capstone project, I solved ten easy-level LeetCode questions and one medium-level question per week and
    presented them during the weekly meeting. By week seven, I presented to CSS 342 peers to share my problem-solving
    strategies and gain feedback from my peers. I also created a website to share one hard-level question, and how I
    solved it. The project carried a multipurpose: to augment personal problem-solving skills, learn from what we
    taught, and promote an environment conducive to peer learning by sharing problem-solving strategies.
  </p>
  <p>The project began in stages, first with individual practice on LeetCode. Solving ten easy-level questions and one
    medium-level question provided a solid foundation for future tasks. These initial exercises helped us familiarize
    ourselves with the problem-solving process and shared insights and strategies with peers through presentations. We
    received constructive feedback that helped enhance our teaching strategies.
  </p>
  <p>The next phase involved translating this knowledge exchange into a broader platform. A website was designed to
    present our detailed problem-solving processes and strategies for a hard-level LeetCode question. This was to
    facilitate more accessible and shared learning experiences among others.
  </p>
  <p>The results of this project were twofold. On a personal level, I improved my problem-solving abilities, gained a
    better understanding of algorithms, and developed the ability to guide peers through complex questions. Meanwhile,
    on a collective level, my peers benefited from exposure to problem-solving strategies.
  </p>
  <p>The significance of this capstone project is the peer instruction in the computer science field. It underscores the
    fact that it helps us get a deeper understanding of the knowledge when we are trying to teach others. It is shared
    and reciprocated.
