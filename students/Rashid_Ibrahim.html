  <h2>Rashid Ibrahim</h2>

  <p>
    As part of my CSS 497 capstone project, I have undertaken a comprehensive exploration of various data structures and
    algorithms, including arrays, linked lists, binary search, trees, and priority queues. This abstract provides a
    summary of my project, highlighting the key topics covered, the outcomes achieved, and the future goals.
  </p>
  <p>Under the guidance of Advisor Yusuf Pisan, I have engaged in weekly problem-solving sessions, honing my
    problem-solving skills and gaining a deep understanding of these fundamental concepts.
  </p>
  <p>The capstone project has also facilitated collaborative learning through weekly group meetings, where I have
    presented and discussed medium-level problems. These sessions have been invaluable for exchanging ideas, refining
    problem-solving techniques, and receiving constructive feedback from my peers.
  </p>
  <p>As a significant milestone of the capstone project, I had the opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation to a CSS
    343 class, showcasing my understanding of the covered topics and demonstrating the application of data structures
    and algorithms. A feedback is gathered on my teaching and presentation skills, and I am eagerly awaiting the
    results.
  </p>
  <p>Looking ahead, I plan to tackle a hard-level LeetCode question as part of my capstone project. This challenge will
    further deepen my problem-solving skills and provide an opportunity to explore more complex algorithms.
    Additionally, I intend to create a GitHub page to showcase my solutions and provide explanations for the hard
    LeetCode problem I am going to solve.
  </p>
  <p>In conclusion, my capstone project has been a transformative learning experience, allowing me to delve into the
    intricacies of data structures and algorithms. Through problem-solving, research, collaboration, and presentations,
    I have expanded my knowledge and applied these concepts to solve programming challenges. This abstract provides an
    overview of the project, emphasizing the topics covered, the methodologies employed, and the upcoming goals of
    tackling a hard-level LeetCode question and creating a GitHub page. By the end of this capstone journey, I aim to
    have a comprehensive understanding of data structures and algorithms.
